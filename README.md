# Project_based_on_Loan_approval_system
In this Project , I'm using Machine Learning (ML)techniques that are very useful in predicting outcomes 
for large amount of data. In this project three machine learning 
algorithms, Logistic Regression(LR), Decision Tree (DT) and Random 
Forest(RF)are applied to predict the loan approval of customers.
