df.boxplot(column='ApplicantIncome')

The above Box Plot confirms the presence of a lot of outliers/extreme values. This can be attributed to the income disparity in the society.

df.boxplot(column='ApplicantIncome', by = 'Education')

We can see that there is no substantial different between the mean income of graduate and non-graduates. But there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, which are appearing to be the outliers

LoanAmount has missing as well as extreme values, while ApplicantIncome has a few extreme values.

Outliers of LoanAmount and Applicant Income
In [19]:

Out[19]:
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x117cd6e48>

The extreme values are practically possible, i.e. some people might apply for high value loans due to specific needs. So instead of treating them as outliers, letâ€™s try a log transformation to nullify their effect:
In [20]:
# Perform log transformation of TotalIncome to make it closer to normal
df['LoanAmount_log'] = np.log(df['LoanAmount'])

# Looking at the distribtion of TotalIncome_log
df['LoanAmount_log'].hist(bins=20)
Out[20]:
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x117dd07b8>

Data Preparation for Model Building
sklearn requires all inputs to be numeric, we should convert all our categorical variables into numeric by encoding the categories. Before that we will fill all the missing values in the dataset.
In [21]:
# Impute missing values for Gender
df['Gender'].fillna(df['Gender'].mode()[0],inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Married
df['Married'].fillna(df['Married'].mode()[0],inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Dependents
df['Dependents'].fillna(df['Dependents'].mode()[0],inplace=True)

# Impute missing values for Credit_History
df['Credit_History'].fillna(df['Credit_History'].mode()[0],inplace=True)

# Convert all non-numeric values to number
cat=['Gender','Married','Dependents','Education','Self_Employed','Credit_History','Property_Area']

    le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
    df[var]=le.fit_transform(df[var].astype('str'))

Logistic Regression Model
The chances of getting a loan will be higher for:

Applicants having a credit history (we observed this in exploration.)
Applicants with higher applicant and co-applicant incomes
Applicants with higher education level
Properties in urban areas with high growth perspectives
So letâ€™s make our model with â€˜Credit_Historyâ€™, 'Education' & 'Gender'

In [28]:
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression


predictors_Logistic=['Credit_History','Education','Gender']

# Train the model using the training sets
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)

#Reverse encoding for predicted outcome
predicted = number.inverse_transform(predicted)

#Store it to test dataset
test_modified['Loan_Status']=predicted

outcome_var = 'Loan_Status'

classification_model(model, df,predictors_Logistic,outcome_var)
